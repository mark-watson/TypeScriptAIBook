# Optional Material: A Deeper Dive Into Semantic Web and Linked Data

In the previous chapter we used TypeScript to query Wikidata and DBPedia with SPARQL and built a knowledge base in SQLite. Those examples gave you working code for practical knowledge representation tasks. This optional chapter provides the theoretical background behind those tools, if you understand the standards that underpin SPARQL endpoints, you will be able to write more sophisticated queries, design your own RDF schemas, and use reasoning to infer new knowledge from existing data.

Specifically, this chapter covers:

- **RDF**: The data format behind Wikidata, DBPedia, and every SPARQL endpoint. Understanding RDF triples, namespaces, and serialization formats will help you design better queries and interpret results from the examples in the previous chapter.
- **RDFS**: How to define sub-properties and class hierarchies so that a single SPARQL query can match related predicates automatically (e.g., querying for "containsPlace" also matches "containsCity" and "containsCountry").
- **SPARQL in depth**: The query patterns, filters, OPTIONAL clauses, and ordering that let you write expressive queries against public knowledge graphs.
- **OWL**: The Web Ontology Language, which extends RDFS with transitive properties, inverse properties, and description logic reasoning.

This material is not required to use the TypeScript examples from the previous chapter, but it will deepen your understanding and help you build more powerful knowledge representation applications.

The scope of the Semantic Web is comprised of all public data sources on the Internet that follow specific standards like RDF. Knowledge Graphs may be large scale, as the graphs that drive Google's and Facebook's businesses, or they can be specific to an organization. Knowledge Graphs may be in customer-facing applications or part of internal engineering infrastructure.

The Semantic Web is a vision for the future of the World Wide Web, where data on the web is represented in a way that machines can understand, reason about, and use to perform tasks. It is built on top of the existing web and is designed to be backward-compatible. The Semantic Web relies on the use of ontologies, which are formal representations of a domain of knowledge, and the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is a standard for expressing ontologies in a machine-readable format.

Linked Data is a set of best practices for publishing and linking data on the web using RDF. It involves the use of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify resources on the web and the use of links (also known as triples) to connect resources. This allows for the creation of a web of interconnected data, where each resource can be linked to other resources in a way that machines can understand and follow.

Together, the Semantic Web and Linked Data provide a framework for representing and interlinking data on the web in a structured and machine-readable format, allowing for the integration, querying, and reasoning over large amounts of information. This helps to make data on the web more accessible and useful to both humans and machines, enabling more powerful and intelligent applications and services.

As a developer you are likely familiar with the term *data lake* for enterprise-wide relational and other types of databases. Graph databases and RDF data stores are another tool to implement *data lakes* but I prefer using the term Knowledge Graph for RDF/RDFS/OWL/SPARQL based data stores because of the ability to infer data that is not explicitly stated as well as providing abstractions for merging different data sources in-place, that is, without the requirement to convert data to other formats or database infrastructure.

## Overview and Theory

You will learn how to do the following:

- Understand RDF data formats (the foundation behind the Wikidata and DBPedia queries from the previous chapter).
- See more use cases for SPARQL queries that go beyond the simple SELECT patterns we used earlier.
- Learn about RDFS sub-property hierarchies and OWL reasoning, which enable more powerful knowledge queries.

The Semantic Web is intended to provide a massive linked set of data for use by software systems just as the World Wide Web provides a massive collection of linked web pages for human reading and browsing. The Semantic Web is like the web in that anyone can generate any content that they want. This freedom to publish anything works for the web because we use our ability to understand natural language to interpret what we read, and often to dismiss material that based upon our own knowledge we consider to be incorrect.

Semantic Web and linked data technologies are also useful for smaller amounts of data, an example being a Knowledge Graph containing information for a business. We will further explore Knowledge Graph use cases.

The core concept for the Semantic Web is data integration and use from different sources. As we will soon see, the tools for implementing the Semantic Web are designed for encoding data and sharing data from many different sources.

I cover the Semantic Web in this book because I believe that Semantic Web technologies are complementary to AI systems for gathering and processing data on the web. As more web pages are generated by applications (as opposed to simply showing static HTML files) it becomes easier to produce both HTML for human readers and semantic data for software agents.

### RDF: The Universal Data Format

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is used to encode information and the RDF Schema (RDFS) facilitates using data with different RDF encodings without the need to convert one set of schemas to another. Later, using OWL, we can simply declare that one predicate (or property) is the same as another; that is, one predicate is a sub-predicate of another (e.g., a property **containsCity** can be declared to be a sub-property of **containsPlace** so if something contains a city then it also contains a place), etc. The predicate part of an RDF statement often refers to a property.

RDF data was originally encoded as XML and intended for automated processing. In this chapter we will use two simple to read formats called “N-Triples” and “N3.” Apache Jena can be used to convert between all RDF formats so we might as well use formats that are easier to read and understand. RDF data consists of a set of triple values:

- subject
- predicate
- object

Some of my work with Semantic Web technologies deals with processing news stories, extracting semantic information from the text, and storing it in RDF. I will use this application domain for the examples in this chapter when we implement code to automatically generate RDF for Knowledge Graphs. I deal with triples like:

- Subject: a URL (or URI) of a news article.
- Predicate (or property): a relation like “containsPerson”.
- Object: a literal value like “Bill Clinton” or a URI representing Bill Clinton.

In general subjects refer to entities. In the next chapter we will use the entity recognition library we developed in an earlier chapter to create RDF from text input.

We will use either URIs or string literals as values for objects. We will always use URIs for representing subjects and predicates. In any case URIs are usually preferred to string literals. We will see an example of this preferred use but first we need to learn the N-Triple and N3 RDF formats.

I propose that the idea that RDF is more flexible than Object Modeling in programming languages, relational databases, and XML with schemas. If we can tag new attributes on the fly to existing data, how do we prevent what I might call “data chaos” as we modify existing data sources? It turns out that the solution to this problem is also the solution for encoding real semantics (or meaning) with data: we usually use unique URIs for RDF subjects, predicates, and objects, and usually with a preference for not using string literals. The definitions of predicates are tied to a namespace and later with OWL we will state the equivalence of predicates in different namespaces with the same semantic meaning. I will try to make this idea more clear with some examples and for further reference [Wikipedia has a good writeup on RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework).

Any part of a triple (subject, predicate, or object) is either a URI or a string literal. URIs encode namespaces. For example, the containsPerson predicate in the last example could be written as:

    http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology/#containsPerson

The first part of this URI is considered to be the namespace for this predicate “containsPerson.” When different RDF triples use this same predicate, this is some assurance to us that all users of this predicate understand the same meaning. Furthermore, we will see later that we can use RDFS to state equivalency between this predicate (in the namespace http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology/) with predicates represented by different URIs used in other data sources. In an “artificial intelligence” sense, software that we write does not understand predicates like “containsCity”, “containsPerson”, or “isLocation” in the way that a human reader can by combining understood common meanings for the words “contains”, “city”, “is”, “person”, and “location” but for many interesting and useful types of applications that is fine as long as the predicate is used consistently. We will see that we can define abbreviation prefixes for namespaces which makes RDF and RDFS files shorter and easier to read.

There are many serialization formats for RDF (we will mostly use JSON in our TypeScript examples):

- Turtle
- N3
- N-Triples
- NQuads
- TriG
-JSON
- JSON-LD
- RDF/XML
- RDF/JSON
- TriX
- RDF Binary

A statement in N-Triple format consists of three URIs (two URIs and a string literals for the object) followed by a period to end the statement. While statements are often written one per line in a source file they can be broken across lines; it is the ending period which marks the end of a statement. The standard file extension for N-Triple format files is *.nt and the standard format for N3 format files is *.n3.

My preference is to use N-Triple format files as output from programs that I write to save data as RDF. N-Triple files don’t use any abbreviations and each RDF statement is self-contained. I often use tools like the command line commands in Jena or RDF4J to convert N-Triple files to N3 or other formats if I will be reading them or even hand editing them. Here is an example using the N3 syntax:

```sparql
@prefix kb:  <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#>

<http://news.com/201234/> kb:containsCountry "China" .
```

The N3 format adds prefixes (abbreviations) to the N-Triple format. In practice it would be better to use the URI http://dbpedia.org/resource/China instead of the literal value “China.”


Here we see the use of an abbreviation prefix “kb:” for the namespace for my company KnowledgeBooks.com ontologies. The first term in the RDF statement (the subject) is the URI of a news article. The second term (the predicate) is “containsCountry” in the “kb:” namespace. The last item in the statement (the object) is a string literal “China.” I would describe this RDF statement in English as, “The news article at URI http://news.com/201234 mentions the country China.”

This was a very simple N3 example which we will expand to show additional features of the N3 notation. As another example, let’s look at the case of this news article also mentioning the USA. Instead of adding a whole new statement like this we can combine them using N3 notation. Here we have two separate RDF statements:

```sparql
@prefix kb:  <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#> .

<http://news.com/201234/>
  kb:containsCountry
  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/China>  .
  
<http://news.com/201234/>
  kb:containsCountry
  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States>  .
```

We can collapse multiple RDF statements that share the same subject and optionally the same predicate:

```sparql
@prefix kb:  <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#> .

<http://news.com/201234/>
  kb:containsCountry
    <http://dbpedia.org/resource/China> ,
    <http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States>  .
```

The indentation and placement on separate lines is arbitrary - use whatever style you like that is readable. We can also add in additional predicates that use the same subject (I am going to use string literals here instead of URIs for objects to make the following example more concise but in practice prefer using URIs):

```sparql
@prefix kb:  <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#> .

<http://news.com/201234/>
        kb:containsCountry "China" ,
                           "USA" .
        kb:containsOrganization "United Nations" ;
        kb:containsPerson "Ban Ki-moon" , "Gordon Brown" ,
                          "Hu Jintao" , "George W. Bush" ,
                          "Pervez Musharraf" ,
                          "Vladimir Putin" , 
                          "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad" .
```

This single N3 statement represents ten individual RDF triples. Each section defining triples with the same subject and predicate have objects separated by commas and ending with a period. Please note that whatever RDF storage system you use (we will be using Jena) it makes no difference if we load RDF as XML, N-Triple, or N3 format files: internally subject, predicate, and object triples are stored in the same way and are used in the same way. RDF triples in a data store represent directed graphs that may not all be connected.

I promised you that the data in RDF data stores was easy to extend. As an example, let us assume that we have written software that is able to read online news articles and create RDF data that captures some of the semantics in the articles. If we extend our program to also recognize dates when the articles are published, we can simply reprocess articles and for each article add a triple to our RDF data store using a form like:

```sparql
@prefix kb:  <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#> .

<http://news.com/201234/>
  kb:datePublished
  "2008-05-11" .
```

Note that I split one RDF statement across three lines (3-5) but this could have been on one line. The RDF statement on lines 3-5 is legal and will be handled correctly by RDF parsers. Here we just represent the date as a string. We can add a type to the object representing a specific date:

```sparql
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix kb:  <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#> .
 
 <http://news.com/201234/>
   kb:datePublished
   "2008-05-11"^^xsd:date .
```

Furthermore, if we do not have dates for all news articles, that is often acceptable because when constructing SPARQL queries you can match optional patterns. If for example you are looking up articles on a specific subject then some results may have a publication date attached to the results for that article and some might not. In practice RDF supports types and we would use a date type as seen in the last example, not a string. However, in designing the example programs for this chapter I decided to simplify our representation of URIs and often use string literals as simple Java strings.

### Extending RDF with RDF Schema

RDF Schema (RDFS) supports the definition of classes and properties based on set inclusion. In RDFS classes and properties are orthogonal. Let’s start with looking at an example using additional namespaces:

```sparql
@prefix kb:   <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#> .
@prefix rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix dbo:  <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> .

<http://news.com/201234/>
  kb:containsCountry
  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/China>  .
  
<http://news.com/201234/>
  kb:containsCountry
  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States>  .
  
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/China>
  rdfs:label "China"@en,
  rdf:type dbo:Place ,
  rdf:type dbo:Country .
```

Because the Semantic Web is intended to be processed automatically by software systems it is encoded as RDF. There is a problem that must be solved in implementing and using the Semantic Web: everyone who publishes Semantic Web data is free to create their own RDF schemas for storing data. For example, there is usually no single standard RDF schema definition for topics like news stories and stock market data. The SKOS is a namespace containing standard schemas and the most widely used standard is schema.org. Understanding the ways of integrating different data sources using different schemas helps to understand the design decisions behind the Semantic Web applications. In this chapter I often use my own schemas in the knowledgebooks.com namespace for the simple examples you see here. When you build your own production systems part of the work is searching through schema.org and SKOS to use standard name spaces and schemas when possible because this facilitates linking your data to other RDF Data on the web. The use of standard schemas helps when you link internal proprietary Knowledge Graphs used inside your organization with public open data from sources like WikiData and DBPedia.

Let’s consider an example: suppose that your local Knowledge Graph referred to President Joe Biden in which case we could “mint” our own URI like:

    https://knowledgebooks.com/person#Joe_Biden

In this case users of the local Knowledge Graph could not take advantage of connected data. For example, the DBPedia and WikiData URIs for Joe Biden are:

    https://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Biden
    http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6279

Both of these URIs can be followed by clicking on the links if you are reading a PDF copy of this book. Please “follow your nose” and see how both of these URIs resolve to human-readable web pages.

After telling you, dear reader, to always try to use public and standard URIs like the above examples for Joe Biden, I will now revert to using simple made-up URIs for the following discussion.

We will start with an example that is an extension of the example in the previous section that also uses RDFS. We add a few additional RDF statements:

```sparql
@prefix kb:  <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#> .
@prefix rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

kb:containsCity rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:containsPlace .
kb:containsCountry rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:containsPlace .
kb:containsState rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:containsPlace .
```

The last three lines declare that:

- The property **containsCity** is a sub-property of **containsPlace**.
- The property **containsCountry** is a sub-property of **containsPlace**.
- The property **containsState** is a sub-property of **containsPlace**.

Why is this useful? For at least two reasons:

You can query an RDF data store for all triples that use property **containsPlace** and also match triples with properties equal to **containsCity**, **containsCountry**, or **containsState**. There may not even be any triples that explicitly use the property **containsPlace**.

Consider a hypothetical case where you are using two different RDF data stores that use different properties for naming cities: **cityName** and **city**. You can define **cityName** to be a sub-property of **city** and then write all queries against the single property name **city**. This removes the necessity to convert data from different sources to use the same Schema. You can also use OWL to state property and class equivalency.

In addition to providing a vocabulary for describing properties and class membership by properties, RDFS is also used for logical inference to infer new triples, combine data from different RDF data sources, and to allow effective querying of RDF data stores. We will see examples of all of these features of RDFS when we later when using libraries to perform SPARQL queries.

### The SPARQL Query Language

We briefly covered the use of SPARQL in the last chapter. SPARQL is a query language used to query RDF data stores. While SPARQL may initially look like SQL, we will see that there are some important differences like support for RDFS and OWL inferencing and graph-based instead of relational matching operations. We will cover the basics of SPARQL in this section and then see more examples later when we learn how to embed SPARQL queries in Python applications.

We will use the N3 format RDF file test_data/news.n3 for the examples. I created this file automatically by spidering Reuters news stories on the news.yahoo.com web site and automatically extracting named entities from the text of the articles. In this chapter we use these sample RDF files.

You have already seen snippets of this file and I list the entire file here for reference, edited to fit line width: you may find the file news.n3 easier to read if you are at your computer and open the file in a text editor so you will not be limited to what fits on a book page:

```sparql

@prefix rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

kb:containsCity rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:containsPlace .

kb:containsCountry rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:containsPlace .

kb:containsState rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:containsPlace .

                                "Oil prices" , "oil" .
```
Please note that in the above RDF listing I took advantage of the free form syntax of N3 and Turtle RDF formats to reformat the data to fit page width.

We will start with a simple SPARQL query for subjects (news article URLs) and objects (matching countries) with the value for the predicate equal to containsCountry. Variables in queries start with a question mark character and can have any names:

```sparql
SELECT ?subject ?object
  WHERE {
   ?subject
   <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#containsCountry>
   ?object .
}
```

It is important for you to understand what is happening when we apply the last SPARQL query to our sample data. Conceptually, all the triples in the sample data are scanned, keeping the ones where the predicate part of a triple is equal to

    http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#containsCountry.

In practice RDF data stores supporting SPARQL queries index RDF data so a complete scan of the sample data is not required. This is analogous to relational databases where indices are created to avoid needing to perform complete scans of database tables.

In practice, when you are exploring a Knowledge Graph like DBPedia or WikiData (that are just very large collections of RDF triples), you might run a query and discover a useful or interesting entity URI in the triple store, then drill down to find out more about the entity. In a later example in this chapter (Knowledge Graph Navigator) we attempt to automate this exploration process using the DBPedia data as a Knowledge Graph.

We will be using the same code to access the small example of RDF statements in our sample data as we will for accessing DBPedia or WikiData.

We can make this last query easier to read and reduce the chance of misspelling errors by using a namespace prefix:

```sparql
PREFIX kb:  <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#>
SELECT ?subject ?object
  WHERE {
      ?subject kb:containsCountry ?object .
  }
```

We could have filtered on any other predicate, for instance **containsPlace**. Here is another example using a match against a string literal to find all articles exactly matching the text “Maryland.”

```sparql
PREFIX kb:  <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#>
SELECT ?subject WHERE { ?subject kb:containsState "Maryland" . }
```

The output is:

    http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080616/ts_nm/worldleaders_trust_dc_1/


We can also match partial string literals against regular expressions:

```sparql
PREFIX kb: <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#>
SELECT ?subject ?object
       WHERE {
         ?subject
         kb:containsOrganization
         ?object FILTER regex(?object, "University") .
       }
```

The output is:

```
http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080616/ts_nm/worldleaders_trust_dc_1
  "University of Maryland"
```

We might want to return all triples matching a property of containing an organization and where the object is a string containing the substring “University.” The matching statement after the FILTER check matches every triple that matches the subject in the first pattern:

```sparql
PREFIX kb: <http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#>
SELECT DISTINCT ?subject ?a_predicate ?an_object
 WHERE {
    ?subject kb:containsOrganization ?object .
       FILTER regex(?object,"University") .
    ?subject ?a_predicate ?an_object .
}
ORDER BY ?a_predicate ?an_object
LIMIT 10
OFFSET 5
```

When WHERE clauses contain more than one triple pattern to match, this is equivalent to a Boolean “and” operation. The DISTINCT clause removes duplicate results. The ORDER BY clause sorts the output in alphabetical order: in this case first by predicate (containsCity, containsCountry, etc.) and then by object. The LIMIT modifier limits the number of results returned and the OFFSET modifier sets the number of matching results to skip.

The output is:

 ```

 	 http://knowledgebooks.com/ontology#containsOrganization

We are finished with our quick tutorial on using the SELECT query form. There are three other query forms that I am not covering in this chapter:

- CONSTRUCT: returns a new RDF graph of query results.
- ASK: returns Boolean true or false indicating if a query matches any triples.
- DESCRIBE: returns a new RDF graph containing matched resources.

We will later use the OPTIONAL query form that allows complex queries to contain patterns that do not have to match.

### OWL: The Web Ontology Language

We have already seen a few examples of using RDFS to define sub-properties in this chapter. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) extends the expressive power of RDFS. We now look at a few OWL examples. The following RDF data stores support at least some level of OWL reasoning:

- ProtegeOwlApis: compatible with the Protege Ontology editor.
- Pellet: DL reasoner.
- Owlim: OWL DL reasoner compatible with some versions of Sesame.
- Jena: General purpose library that is used in Apache Jena Fuseki.
- OWLAPI: a simpler API using many other libraries.
- Stardog: a commercial OWL and RDF reasoning system and datastore.
- Allegrograph: a commercial RDF+ and RDF reasoning system and datastore.

OWL is more expressive than RDFS in that it supports cardinality, richer class relationships, and Descriptive Logic (DL) reasoning. OWL treats the idea of classes very differently than object oriented programming languages like Java and Smalltalk. In OWL, instances of a class are referred to as individuals and class membership is determined by a set of properties that allow a DL reasoner to infer class membership of an individual (this is called entailment.)

We have been using the RDF file news.n3 in previous examples and we will layer new examples by adding new triples that represent RDF, RDFS, and OWL. We saw in news.n3 the definition of three triples using **rdfs:subPropertyOf** properties to create a more general **kb:containsPlace** property:

```sparql
kb:containsCity rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:containsPlace .
kb:containsCountry rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:containsPlace .
kb:containsState rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:containsPlace .

kb:containsPlace rdf:type owl:transitiveProperty .

kbplace:UnitedStates kb:containsState kbplace:Illinois .
kbplace:Illinois kb:containsCity kbplace:Chicago .
```

We can also infer that:

```sparql
kbplace:UnitedStates kb:containsPlace kbplace:Chicago .
```

We can also model inverse properties in OWL. For example, here we add an inverse property kb:containedIn, adding it to the example in the last listing:

```sparql
kb:containedIn owl:inverseOf kb:containsPlace .
```

Given an RDF container that supported OWL, we can now execute SPARQL queries matching the property kb:containedIn and “match” triples in the RDF triple store that have never been asserted but are inferred by the OWL reasoner.

You should understand the concept of class membership not by explicitly stating that an object (or individual) is a member of a class, but rather because an individual has properties that can be used to infer class membership.

The World Wide Web Consortium has defined three versions of the OWL language that are in increasing order of complexity: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full. OWL DL (supports Description Logic) is the most widely used (and recommended) version of OWL. OWL Full is not computationally decidable since it supports full logic, multiple class inheritance, and other things that probably make it computationally intractable for all but smaller problems.
